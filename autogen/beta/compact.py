"""CompactStrategy — reduces stream history to respect system constraints.

Compaction protects runtime stability. It is the constraint-respecting
operation: triggered when measurable limits (event count, token count)
are approached. Returns a reduced event list that replaces the current
stream history.

Compaction removes. Aggregation creates. They are separate concerns.
